A simple Angular CRUD project which adds a shopping list where you can add, delete, and modify things you've added to your shopping list. Also, you need to start CRUD-Shopping-List-Back-End code, so be sure to clone that repo as well.

I suggest you to read through all documentation for better understanding of the commands you can use.
